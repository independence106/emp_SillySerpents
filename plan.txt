- Determine the time at the beginning of the linear search invocation and store it as a "start"
- Determine the time at the end
- Find their difference in the start and end times (time taken) and return it
- Determine the maximum time it takes to find any certain index (WORST CASE)
- Determine total time to search everything in an array
- Adjust the above to work with the binary search
- Analyze the data and draw conclusions
