## Tests Performed: 
  - Searched for random numbers in arrays varying in length multiple times
  - Searched for first, last, middle elements in arrays varying in length multiple times
  - Searched for total time to searchf for every element in arrays varying in length
  - Searched an array and its individual elements, comparing binsearch to linsearch
 
## Results: 
  - For random searches, random search is almost always faster
  - Bin Search is always faster for elements at the end of an arr or in the middle, but almost always slower for values at the beginning
  - Bin Search is always faster than lin search for total search time
  - Bin Search is almost always faster than lin search for individual element search time, with a few outliers

## Conclusion: 
  - Bin Search is faster overall for the entire search space, and in general
  - Lin Search is only faster for beginning values of the array (THAT ARE IN THE ARRAY)
  - Bin Search is much faster than lin search
